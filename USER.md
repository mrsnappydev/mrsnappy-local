## Context

Paul is building **MrSnappy Local** — a privacy-focused local AI assistant. He's got serious hardware (Ryzen 9 9950X, dual RTX 5060 Ti, 128GB RAM) and runs Ubuntu.

The project is a Next.js web app that interfaces with Ollama and LM Studio for local LLM inference. Key philosophy: no cloud, no subscriptions, data never leaves the device.
